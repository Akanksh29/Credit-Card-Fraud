# Credit-Card-Fraud
This project includes looking at a dataset of anonymized features of a credit card transaction and whether it wasa fraud or not. We have cleaned the dataset and observed which features affect the possibility of being a fraud. Then we choose the best fit model among different models using hyper tuning of paramters.
